    "** Advent of Code Day 21 - Part 1 ** You find a program trying to generate some art. It uses a strange process that involves repeatedly enhancing the detail of an image through a set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image consists of a two-dimensional square grid of pixels that are either on (#) or off (.). The program always begins with this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    ".#.\n",
    "..#\n",
    "###\n",
    "Because the pattern is both 3 pixels wide and 3 pixels tall, it is said to have a size of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the program repeats the following process:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the size is evenly divisible by 2, break the pixels up into 2x2 squares, and convert each 2x2 square into a 3x3 square by following the corresponding enhancement rule.\n",
    "Otherwise, the size is evenly divisible by 3; break the pixels up into 3x3 squares, and convert each 3x3 square into a 4x4 square by following the corresponding enhancement rule.\n",
    "Because each square of pixels is replaced by a larger one, the image gains pixels and so its size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The artist's book of enhancement rules is nearby (your puzzle input); however, it seems to be missing rules. The artist explains that sometimes, one must rotate or flip the input pattern to find a match. (Never rotate or flip the output pattern, though.) Each pattern is written concisely: rows are listed as single units, ordered top-down, and separated by slashes. For example, the following rules correspond to the adjacent patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "../.#  =  ..\n",
    "          .#\n",
    "\n",
    "                .#.\n",
    ".#./..#/###  =  ..#\n",
    "                ###\n",
    "\n",
    "                        #..#\n",
    "#..#/..../#..#/.##.  =  ....\n",
    "                        #..#\n",
    "                        .##.\n",
    "When searching for a rule to use, rotate and flip the pattern as necessary. For example, all of the following patterns match the same rule:\n",
    "\n",
    ".#.   .#.   #..   ###\n",
    "..#   #..   #.#   ..#\n",
    "###   ###   ##.   .#.\n",
    "Suppose the book contained the following two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "../.# => ##./#../...\n",
    ".#./..#/### => #..#/..../..../#..#\n",
    "As before, the program begins with this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    ".#.\n",
    "..#\n",
    "###\n",
    "The size of the grid (3) is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3. It divides evenly into a single square; the square matches the second rule, which produces:\n",
    "\n",
    "#..#\n",
    "....\n",
    "....\n",
    "#..#\n",
    "The size of this enhanced grid (4) is evenly divisible by 2, so that rule is used. It divides evenly into four squares:\n",
    "\n",
    "#.|.#\n",
    "..|..\n",
    "--+--\n",
    "..|..\n",
    "#.|.#\n",
    "Each of these squares matches the same rule (../.# => ##./#../...), three of which require some flipping and rotation to line up with the rule. The output for the rule is the same in all four cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "##.|##.\n",
    "#..|#..\n",
    "...|...\n",
    "---+---\n",
    "##.|##.\n",
    "#..|#..\n",
    "...|...\n",
    "Finally, the squares are joined into a new grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "##.##.\n",
    "#..#..\n",
    "......\n",
    "##.##.\n",
    "#..#..\n",
    "......\n",
    "Thus, after 2 iterations, the grid contains 12 pixels that are on.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many pixels stay on after 5 iterations?"

Rather than bother the sound card with it, you decide to run the code yourself. Unfortunately, you don't see any documentation, so you're left to figure out what the instructions mean on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like the assembly is meant to operate on a set of registers that are each named with a single letter and that can each hold a single integer. You suppose each register should start with a value of 0.\n",

    "rcv X recovers the frequency of the last sound played, but only when the value of X is not zero. (If it is zero, the command does nothing.)\n",
    "jgz X Y jumps with an offset of the value of Y, but only if the value of X is greater than zero. (An offset of 2 skips the next instruction, an offset of -1 jumps to the previous instruction, and so on.)\n",
    "Many of the instructions can take either a register (a single letter) or a number. The value of a register is the integer it contains; the value of a number is that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each jump instruction, the program continues with the instruction to which the jump jumped. After any other instruction, the program continues with the next instruction. Continuing (or jumping) off either end of the program terminates it.\n",

    "\n",
    "set a 1\n",

    "jgz a -2\n",
    "The first four instructions set a to 1, add 2 to it, square it, and then set it to itself modulo 5, resulting in a value of 4.\n",
    "Then, a sound with frequency 4 (the value of a) is played.\n",
    "After that, a is set to 0, causing the subsequent rcv and jgz instructions to both be skipped (rcv because a is 0, and jgz because a is not greater than 0).\n",

    "\n",
    "Each running copy of the program has its own set of registers and follows the code independently - in fact, the programs don't even necessarily run at the same speed. To coordinate, they use the send (snd) and receive (rcv) instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "snd X sends the value of X to the other program. These values wait in a queue until that program is ready to receive them. Each program has its own message queue, so a program can never receive a message it sent.\n",
    "rcv X receives the next value and stores it in register X. If no values are in the queue, the program waits for a value to be sent to it. Programs do not continue to the next instruction until they have received a value. Values are received in the order they are sent.\n",
    "Each program also has its own program ID (one 0 and the other 1); the register p should begin with this value.\n",

    "Both programs begin by sending three values to the other. Program 0 sends 1, 2, 0; program 1 sends 1, 2, 1. Then, each program receives a value (both 1) and stores it in a, receives another value (both 2) and stores it in b, and then each receives the program ID of the other program (program 0 receives 1; program 1 receives 0) and stores it in c. Each program now sees a different value in its own copy of register c.\n",
